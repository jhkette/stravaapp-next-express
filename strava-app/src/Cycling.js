        This is a power chart showing your power records for various time
        periods. Ideally, you wouldd want a high peak over the very short
        periods. For the longer periods it should only very gradually level out.
        Your FTP is marked with a dotted line - this is the theoretical power
        you can hold for an hour - based on an extrapolation from other time
        periods.{" "}

          Climbing is an important part of cycling. Here, I have used two
          datasets from Strava segments. These are short routes that Strava
          times to create a leaderboard. Bealach-na-ba represents your climbing ability over longer periods, whereas 
          Hardknott pass is a shorter climb - that should take between 10 and 20 minutes.

             Hardknott pass is a climb in the Lake District with gradients of up to 30%. It is a shorter climb that should represent something between a 10 and 20 minute max effort.
