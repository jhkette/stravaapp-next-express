# Node/React Strava API application

## NOTE! The original application was built for a Bsc computing project. The folders with my Bsc work were in Node (the node/express server) and strava-app, which was built using create react-app. I am in the process of moving the entire app to a nextjs application. This is in the strava folder. I kept it in this repo as I initially still relied on the node/express server. I am now moving this over to Next API routes but this is not completely finished. The Cypress folder contains end to end tests fot eh Bsc project.

This application takes data from the Strava API to analyse a user's data. The app produces a cycling power curve and a pace graph, from raw strava data. This is data then used to make predictions. A user's 5k performance is used to esimtate their performance over longer distances using linear regression. I also use a power graph and the athlete's weight to estimate time up a climb.

## Description of folders

The strava-app is the front end of the applications made in React. The node folder is the server
made using node/express. The cypress folder just contains end to end testing files.

## The Live site

[http://159.65.83.17/](http://159.65.83.17/)/).

Please use the test Strava account I have given at the top of the report for authentication. 

## Instructions for local node-react strava app

Run git clone or download a zip file of the code. Then from the command line cd into the root of the entire project.
To then start the node server you need to run:

```
cd node
```
```
npm install
```
```
npm run start
```
Then return to the root of the project and start the react client by running:

```
cd strava-app
```
```
npm install
```
```
npm run start
```
This will start a localserver and your browser should open a window
on localhost:8080. 

To use cypress to test the main (live) application run ```npm test``` in the root directory of the whole project. 
To run the unit tests in the node folder cd into the node server folder and run ```npm test```
